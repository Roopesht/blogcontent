Tests pass. APIs respond correctly.</p><p>On the surface, everything looks fine. Underneath, the learning signals that once came from struggle are fading.</p>"

In that model, productivity is no longer measured by how much code a developer writes, but by how effectively they direct, evaluate, and integrate AI-generated output.</p><p>The implication is subtle but important: when AI removes visible effort and common mistakes, expectations rise quietly. Teams don’t announce higher standards. They simply begin assuming them.</p>"

It’s because the environment no longer exposes foundational cracks the way it used to.</p><p>The bar moved — without telling anyone.</p>"

It will be who understands what AI is quietly deciding for them.</p><p>That kind of clarity doesn’t come from randomness. It comes from structured thinking.</p>"
